# Expense Fraud & Anomaly Detection

This project replicates internal finance and audit controls by detecting anomalous expense claims
using statistical thresholds and rule-based logic.

### Business Problem
Organizations must monitor employee expense claims to ensure policy compliance and reduce financial risk.
Manual review processes are time-consuming and prone to oversight.

### Data
- Simulated expense transaction data reflecting real-world AP workflows
- Variables include transaction amount, expense type, submission timing, and employee ID

### Tools & Methods
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Rule-based anomaly detection (thresholds, policy checks)
- Statistical techniques (outlier detection)

### Key Insights
- High-value claims and weekend submissions were more likely to be anomalous
- Rule-based detection provided strong interpretability for audit and compliance teams
- Reduced false positives by focusing on high-risk patterns

### Outcome
The project demonstrates how analytics can enhance internal controls while maintaining transparency
and auditability in financial processes.
